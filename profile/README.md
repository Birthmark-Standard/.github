# The Birthmark Standard Foundation

 

**Public good infrastructure for trust in digital media**

 

---

 

## Our Mission

 

The Birthmark Standard Foundation develops and maintains open-source media authentication infrastructure as a public good. We believe the tools for verifying what's real should be accessible to everyone—independent of corporate platforms, government control, or commercial gatekeepers.


 
## Projects

### [Birthmark](https://github.com/Birthmark-Standard/Birthmark)
Complete Phase 1 implementation including Raspberry Pi camera prototype, submission server, blockchain (Substrate-based), and verification tools. Hardware-backed photo authentication with 69% storage optimization.



## Why We Exist

 

In an era where AI-generated content is indistinguishable from reality, trust in media is collapsing. Authentication infrastructure is too important to be controlled by any single entity. Like HTTPS or email protocols, it should be open, transparent, and owned by no one.

 

## Our Approach

 

We build technology that proves media originated from legitimate devices—cameras, microphones, recording equipment—using hardware-backed verification that survives metadata stripping and platform sharing.

 

**Core Principles:**

- 🌐 **Public good, not commercial product** - Infrastructure should serve everyone

- 🤝 **Coalition governance** - Trust distributed across journalism organizations, universities, and archives

- 🔓 **Open source and auditable** - No black boxes, full transparency

- 🔒 **Privacy-preserving by design** - Verification without surveillance

- ⚖️ **Independence** - No corporate or governmental gatekeepers

 

## Coalition Role

 

The Foundation serves as both a technology developer and a voting member in the Media Validation Network coalition. We will work alongside mission-driven trusted organizations, universities, and digital archives to operate and govern authentication infrastructure that serves the public interest.

 

## Current Work

 

**Birthmark Media Registry** - Our first project: a blockchain-based system for authenticating photographs using camera sensor fingerprints. We're building hardware prototypes and validation infrastructure to demonstrate the complete authentication pipeline before pursuing manufacturer partnerships.

 

**Status:** Foundation forming (501(c)(3) pending) | Phase 1 prototype development in progress

 

## Get Involved

 

- **Developers** - Review architecture, contribute code, security audits

- **Journalists & Photographers** - Join pilot testing, provide workflow feedback

- **Institutions** - Explore coalition membership and validator node operation

- **Manufacturers** - Discuss hardware integration partnerships
