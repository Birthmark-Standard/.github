# The Birthmark Standard Foundation

**Open-source infrastructure for trust in digital media**

---

We're building hardware-backed photo authentication as a public good. Our technology proves images originated from real cameras—not AI generators—using cryptographic verification that survives metadata stripping, social media sharing, and format conversion.

## Our Mission

To develop and maintain open-source, privacy-preserving media authentication infrastructure, enabling individuals and institutions to verify the origin and authenticity of digital media independently of corporate or governmental gatekeepers.

## What We're Building

The Birthmark Standard uses camera sensor fingerprints combined with blockchain verification to create tamper-proof image provenance. Unlike metadata-based solutions, our authentication persists even when images are copied, cropped, or shared across platforms.

**Target deployment:** 2028 Presidential Election

## Repositories

### [Birthmark](https://github.com/Birthmark-Standard/Birthmark)
Core implementation including camera prototypes, aggregation server, manufacturer authority simulation, smart contracts, and verification tools.

*More repositories coming as the project matures.*

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Hardware Prototype**  
Building a Raspberry Pi-based camera that demonstrates the complete authentication pipeline, validated with photography clubs before pursuing manufacturer partnerships.

## Get Involved

- **Developers** - Review architecture, contribute code, security audits
- **Photographers** - Join user testing, provide workflow feedback
- **Journalists** - Discuss authentication needs for your work
- **Manufacturers** - Explore hardware integration partnerships

## Core Principles

- 🔓 Open source and publicly auditable
- 🔒 Privacy-preserving by design
- 🌐 Decentralized, no gatekeepers
- 🤝 Complementary to existing standards (C2PA)
- ⚖️ Public good, not commercial product

## About Us

The Birthmark Standard Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (pending) based in Portland, Oregon. We believe media authentication infrastructure should be open, transparent, and accessible to everyone.
